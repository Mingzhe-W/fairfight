# fairfight: Verifiable Benchmark for MLaaS

## Introduction
In an era where Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) is rapidly growing, ensuring the integrity and reliability of these services is paramount. The DamnFair team proposes a verifiable benchmark to prevent MLaaS scams, safeguarding the quality and trustworthiness of machine learning services.

## Project Overview
Our project aims to introduce a standardized, verifiable benchmark for MLaaS offerings. This benchmark is designed to:

- Evaluate the performance and accuracy of various MLaaS providers.
- Ensure that the machine learning models provided by these services are genuine, robust, and perform as advertised.
- Protect users from potential scams and fraudulent activities in the MLaaS domain.
