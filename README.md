# DamnFair: Verifiable Benchmark for MLaaS

## Introduction
Welcome to DamnFair, a project pioneered by Thomas Zhang, Mingzhe Wang, and Yolanda Ying. Our mission is to establish a verifiable benchmark that fortifies the integrity of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) and protects against fraudulent activities in the domain.

## Project Overview
DamnFair introduces a groundbreaking zero-knowledge machine learning system designed to:

- **Authenticate ML Models:** Enable users to confirm the authenticity of ML models, thus ensuring they get the service quality they pay for.
- **Enhance Data Privacy:** Safeguard the privacy of data used in machine learning services.
- **Counteract MLaaS Scams:** Provide mechanisms to prevent and identify scams in MLaaS, enhancing trust in these services.

## Features
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof System:** Utilizes advanced cryptographic techniques for model verification without compromising data privacy.
- **Benchmarking and Validation:** Comprehensive tools to assess the performance claims of MLaaS providers against actual performance metrics.
- **Transparency and Trust:** Establishes a transparent environment where MLaaS providers' claims can be independently verified.

## Case Studies
- **Alice's Team:**
  - Actual Accuracy: 66.67%
  - Claimed Accuracy: 85%
- **Bobâ€™s Team:**
  - Actual Accuracy: 86.90%
  - Claimed Accuracy: 85%

These case studies highlight the potential discrepancies between claimed and actual model accuracies, underlining the need for our solution.
